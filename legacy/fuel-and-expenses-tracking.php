<!--Great question! While your Financial Insight module covers broad financial health, it's essential to have a dedicated section for Fuel & Expense Tracking for the following reasons — especially in the Indian context:

✅ Why You Need a Separate Fuel & Expense Tracking Section
📌 1. Fuel is the Largest Recurring Expense
In India, fuel costs can account for up to 40–60% of total fleet operating expenses.


Fuel price volatility and regional rate variations (due to state taxes) make real-time monitoring crucial.


📌 2. Fraud Prevention & Leak Control
Fuel theft and manipulation are major problems in India.


GPS + fuel sensor data comparison helps detect fuel theft or manipulation.


📌 3. Driver Accountability
Helps track driver behavior affecting fuel (idling, rash driving, route detours).


You can assign fuel economy KPIs for individual drivers.


📌 4. Fuel Subsidy & Reimbursement Eligibility
In India, commercial vehicles may qualify for fuel subsidies or toll exemptions.


Separate logging helps in claiming such benefits.


📌 5. Integration with Fuel Cards & Wallets
Indian fleet owners increasingly use fuel cards (HPCL, IOCL, BPCL) or UPI apps.


You need integration to track usage and verify receipt-to-disbursement alignment.
